# 🎬 AETHER-GEN | Premium Text-to-Video Platform

A high-performance, production-grade text-to-video generation platform built with FastAPI, PyTorch, and Diffusers. Optimized for speed, reliability, and elite visual presentation.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Fast Inference**: Optimized defaults (ZeroScope V2) for sub-minute generations.
- **Real-Time Telemetry**: WebSocket-driven progress streaming from the GPU.
- **Premium UI**: Dark futuristic dashboard with glassmorphism and smooth animations.
- **Robust Backend**: Async task management with thread-safe callbacks.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) handles the API and WebSocket orchestration.
- **Inference**: PyTorch + Diffusers (ZeroScope V2) for video synthesis.
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + CSS3 (Modern Grid/Flexbox) for a zero-latency interface.

## 🛠️ Setup & Run
1. **Install Requirements**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Launch Platform**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Access**: `http://localhost:8000`
